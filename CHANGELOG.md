## 2026-01-31 - Plotly Migration and Enhanced Interactivity

### Changed
- **Migrated all tabs from Recharts to Plotly.js** for true drag-to-zoom functionality:
  - VIINA tab → `ViinaTabPlotly.tsx`
  - Conflict Events tab → `ConflictEventsTabPlotly.tsx`
  - Aerial Assaults tab → `AerialAssaultsTabPlotly.tsx`
  - Equipment tab → `EquipmentTabPlotly.tsx`
  - Bellingcat tab → `BellingcatTabPlotly.tsx`
  - Humanitarian tab → `HumanitarianTabPlotly.tsx`

### Added
- **Native drag-to-zoom** on all charts - drag a region to zoom, double-click to reset
- **Range sliders** on time series charts for quick date range navigation
- **Consistent dark theme** across all Plotly charts:
  - Dark tooltips with white text (`#1a1a2e` background, `#fff` text)
  - Improved axis label visibility (`#b0b0b0` instead of `#888`)
  - Transparent chart backgrounds for seamless integration
- **Instant source navigation** - Clicking source links (e.g., "(VIINA)") immediately jumps to the corresponding source card in the Sources tab
- **Orange pulsing highlight animation** - When navigating to a source, the card pulses orange 3 times to draw attention
- **Deep linking support** - URLs like `#sources-viina` link directly to specific source cards

### Technical
- Added `hoverlabel` configuration to all Plotly traces for consistent tooltip styling
- Added CSS-based Plotly tooltip styling in `components.css`
- Added `SOURCE_ID_MAP` pattern for mapping display names to element IDs
- Implemented hash-based deep linking with 150ms delay for React render timing
- Added `@keyframes source-pulse` animation for source card highlighting
- **Legend click behavior**: `itemclick: 'toggleothers'` - click to isolate one series, double-click to toggle
- Fixed funding gap chart to filter out records with null requirements
